# Tripsearch

## Project Introduction
It is my first rails project. I created a web search website based on rails. A user can log in and search for a destination that they want to visit and save it in a wishlist. It has several different models with one_to_many, many_to_many associations. Demo: https://tripsearch.herokuapp.com/

## Working Flow
Step1: You can login with email: john@ga.co password: chicken . After the user login, the user can search destinations by countries, cities or attractions, and the user does not have to type the full name of that destination.

If the user only type ja in search area, it will match Japan in its database.
